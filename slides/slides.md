# poem #1

<br/>
<span class="highlight">
  The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.<br/>
  The name that can be named is not the eternal name.<br/>
</span>
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth.<br/>
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.<br/>
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.<br/>
Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.<br/>
These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness.<br/>
Darkness within darkness.<br/>
The gate to all mystery.<br/>

# poem #32

<br/>
The Tao is forever undefined.<br/>
Small though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped.<br/>
If kings and lords could harness it,<br/>
The ten thousand things would come together<br/>
And gentle rain fall.<br/>
Men would need no more instruction and all things would take their course.<br/>
<span class="highlight">
  Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.<br/>
  There are already enough names.<br/>
  One must know when to stop.<br/>
  Knowing when to stop averts trouble.<br/>
</span>
Tao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.<br/>
