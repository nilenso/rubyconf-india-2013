## nature
## "the way"
## the perfect human

!NOTES

General Taoist philosophy; not just the Tao Te Ching.

Taoist religion is wildly different from Taoist philosophy, and contains a lot of 
magic potions, rituals, and other BS.

The concept of "The Perfect Man" as written about in Taoist literature rarely speaks 
to the process of becoming perfect, but rather the behaviours of those (the wise) 
who have supposedly attained perfection.

  The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.<br/>
  The name that can be named is not the eternal name.<br/>

The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth.<br/>
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.<br/>
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.<br/>
Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.<br/>
These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness.<br/>
Darkness within darkness.<br/>

The Tao is forever undefined.<br/>
Small though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped.<br/>
If kings and lords could harness it,<br/>
The ten thousand things would come together<br/>
And gentle rain fall.<br/>
Men would need no more instruction and all things would take their course.<br/>

  Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.<br/>
  There are already enough names.<br/>

Better to stop short than fill to the brim.<br/>
Oversharpen the blade, and the edge will soon blunt.<br/>
Amass a store of gold and jade, and no one can protect it.<br/>

  Claim wealth and titles, and disaster will follow.<br/>
  Retire when the work is done.<br/>

<br/>
Accept disgrace willingly.<br/>
Accept misfortune as the human condition.<br/>
What do you mean by "Accept disgrace willingly"?<br/>
<span class="highlight">
  Accept being unimportant.<br/>
</span>
Do not be concerned with loss or gain.<br/>
This is called "accepting disgrace willingly."<br/>
What do you mean by "Accept misfortune as the human condition"?<br/>
<span class="highlight">
  Misfortune comes from having a body.<br/>
</span>
Without a body, how could there be misfortune?<br/>
Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things.<br/>
Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.<br/>

Empty yourself of everything.<br/>
Let the mind become still.<br/>
<span class="highlight">
  The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return.<br/>
  They grow and flourish and then return to the source.<br/>
  Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature.<br/>
  The way of nature is unchanging.<br/>
</span>
Knowing constancy is insight.<br/>
Not knowing constancy leads to disaster.<br/>
Knowing constancy, the mind is open.<br/>
With an open mind, you will be openhearted.<br/>
Being openhearted, you will act royally.<br/>
Being royal, you will attain the divine.<br/>
Being divine, you will be at one with the Tao.<br/>
Being at one with the Tao is eternal.<br/>
And though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.<br/>

  If heaven and Earth cannot make things eternal,<br/>

</span>
He who follows the Tao<br/>
Is at one with the Tao.<br/>
He who is virtuous<br/>
Experiences Virtue.<br/>
He who loses the way<br/>
Is lost.<br/>
When you are at one with the Tao,<br/>
The Tao welcomes you.<br/>
When you are at one with Virtue,<br/>
The Virtue is always there.<br/>
When you are at one with loss,<br/>
The loss is experienced willingly.<br/>
He who does not trust enough<br/>
Will not be trusted.<br/>

In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.<br/>
In speech, be true.<br/>
In ruling, be just.<br/>
In business, be competent.<br/>

Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao,<br/>

  Counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe.<br/>
  For this would only cause resistance.<br/>

Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed.<br/>
Lean years follow in the wake of a great war.<br/>
Just do what needs to be done.<br/>
Never take advantage of power.<br/>
Achieve results,<br/>
But never glory in them.<br/>
Achieve results,<br/>
But never boast.<br/>
Achieve results,<br/>
But never be proud.<br/>
Achieve results,<br/>
Because this is the natural way.<br/>
<span class="highlight">
  Achieve results,<br/>

!NOTES

Chuang Tzu's "Dextrous Butcher":

There is a story of Cook Ting, cook to Lord Wen-hui. Ting seemed to carve meat as if by magic. Wen-hui asked him how he could possibly achieve such skill.

"What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill.

"A good cook changes his knife once a year - because he cuts. A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month - because he hacks. I've had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I've cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there's plenty of room - more than enough for the blade to play about it.

"However, whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the difficulties, tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on what I'm doing, work very slowly, and move the knife with the greatest subtlety, until - flop! the whole thing comes apart like a clod of earth crumbling to the ground. I stand there holding the knife and look all around me, completely satisfied and reluctant to move on, and then I wipe off the knife and put it away.
